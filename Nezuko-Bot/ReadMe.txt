Steps to Create token.txt
Navigate to the Project Directory:
Open your project directory in your preferred file explorer or terminal.

Create a New Text File:

Create a file named token.txt in the path: bin\Debug\net7.0
Ensure the file is named exactly token.txt (case-sensitive).
Add Your Bot Token:

Open token.txt in a text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code).
Paste your Discord bot token inside the file as a single line:
Copy code
YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
Replace YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN with your actual bot token from the Discord Developer Portal.
Save and Close the File.

Ensure token.txt is Ignored by Git:

The .gitignore file should already include token.txt to prevent it from being uploaded to GitHub.
If you donâ€™t see it listed, add token.txt as a new line in .gitignore.
